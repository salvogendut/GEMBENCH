 * The app provides only its buffer and three hooks:
 *   on_new()         reset to an empty document
 *   on_open(len)     buf now holds a `len`-byte file just loaded - parse it
 *   on_save() -> len fill buf with the document, return the byte count to write
 * Mark edits with gb_doc_dirty() so New / Load / close can offer to save first.
 * Apps can set GB_DOC_LOAD_NOCONFIRM when LOAD should behave like BASIC LOAD:
 * discard the current contents and leave the newly loaded file clean.
 *
 * Recipe: call gb_doc(&doc) before gb_wm_run; in your on_event call
 * gb_doc_event() first (returns 1 if the framework consumed the event); in your
 * on_frame call gb_doc_frame() (runs a pending File menu). Add app-specific
