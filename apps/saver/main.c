/* saver - SQUARES: the GEOBENCH screensaver (#281, replaces the banding CIRCLE).
 *
 * Random rectangles popping up all over the screen - random size, position and
 * colour - with a periodic full clear. gb_fill IS the square primitive, so every
 * square is exact by construction (no curve rasterising to go wrong, none of the
 * overlap artifacts that made the circle saver degenerate into solid bands).
 *
 * A screensaver is just an app (built like any other, shipped with a .SAV extension
 * instead of .APP). The desktop's idle timer launches it via gb_wm_open after the
 * SAVER timeout; it runs as a normal co-resident window. What makes it a "saver":
 *   - it sets WM_FS so the desktop's top bar steps aside and it owns all 200 lines;
 *   - its per-frame handler animates, and closes the moment it sees ANY input
 *     (a typed key, a click/fire/ESC, or a pointer move), handing back to the desktop. */
